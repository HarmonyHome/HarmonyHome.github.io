Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that manifests primarily as a difficulty with written language, particularly with reading and spelling. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate reading instruction.

Evidence suggests that dyslexia results from differences in how the brain processes written and/or verbal language. Although dyslexia is the result of a neurological difference, it is not an intellectual disability.  Dyslexia occurs at all levels of intelligence, average, above average, and highly gifted.
 
## What can contribute to dyslexia?
It is believed that dyslexia is caused by a neurological abnormality that affects the way sufferers process words. Developmental dyslexia also appears to have a genetic component, such that it can tend to occur in multiple members of the same family. Reading difficulties in dyslexia can vary in their severity. The condition is not restricted to childhood, and can persist through adulthood. In addition, while early reports suggested dyslexia is more prevalent in boys, more recent studies have indicated it is not sex-linked, and occurs both in boys and girls with equal frequency.

## Need assessment on the condition?
Yes. School guidance personnel or general practitioner could refer child to their school / educational psychologist or assessment services of the Department of Health respectively.  Specialists in the private sector could also do assessment for the child.

## What parents can do to improve the condition:
* Accept and understand your child’s conditions and let him/her know you are willing to help
* Play games that involve words and parallel reading increase child’s motivation towards words
* Use multi-sensory training to assist your child to memorize words
* Be positive! Your child will learn from you.  The condition needs both you and your child to sustain your positive attitude particularly for children in H.K.
* Parents should manage their stress in order to keep calm when they are helping their children
