### Express Gratitude
People who are consistently grateful have been found to be relatively happier, more energetic, and more hopeful and to report experiencing more frequent positive emotions.

### Cultivate Optimism
Cultivating optimism has a lot in common with cultivating gratitude. Both strategies involve the habit of striving to make out the positive side of your situation.

### Avoid Overthinking
Overthinking ushers in a host of adverse consequences: It sustains or worsens sadness, fosters negatively biased thinking, impairs a person’s ability to solve problems, saps motivation, and interferes with concentration and initiative.

### Avoid Social Comparison
Social comparisons are particularly invidious because no matter how successful, wealthy, or fortunate we become, there’s always someone who can best us. You can’t be envious and happy at the same time.

### Invest in Social Connections
The centrality of social connections to our health and well-being cannot be overstressed.

### Live in the Present
The present moment is all we are really guaranteed. Instead of mulling over the past, it is much better to learn to seize the moment.

### Exercise and Smile
Research has clearly indicated that doing exercise can make one feel fresher and happier. It also indicated that our brain cannot differentiate "true" and "fake" smile. As long as you are smiling, you will be able to get its many benefits.

#### Note:
If you have been feeling down for a consistently long period of time, or your academic, occupational, and daily functioning is significantly affected, it is in your best interests to seek professional help.
