author: Eliza

Intelligence or so-called IQ tests are intended to measure intellectual capacities and provide an estimate of the individual’s mental abilities in various domains such as verbal comprehension, factual knowledge, abstract reasoning, visual-spatial abilities and short-term memory.

The Wechsler tests and Stanford Binet tests are the assessment tools that we commonly use. They have to be performed by professionally trained clinical/educational psychologists.

Assessment results enable parents and teachers gain a better understanding of the child's relative strengths and weaknesses.  Recommendations will also be given in an attempt to address the child’s areas for further improvement.
