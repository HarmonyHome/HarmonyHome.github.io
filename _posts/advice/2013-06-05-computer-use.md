Many parents have similar complaints and worries.

“*She never stops using the computer!*” father complains. “*She never gets enough rest, I wonder if she is suffering from internet addiction?*”

Many adolescents harbor similar grudges against their parents.

“*I’m not playing games! I just need to use the computer to search for information so I can complete my project. They never believe what I say.*”

Learning more about “computer” can help alleviate some of the parents’ worries.

Adopting a different tone of voice or minding the words you use can greatly facilitate your communication with teenagers.

**Parent**: Can you teach me MSN？

**Child**: (*looks puzzled*…)

**Parent**: I want to know more about online games！

**Child**: (*Thinking to himself*, “*What’s going on here?…*”)

**Parent**: I know I can learn it from books but I saw you teaching people. You are very good at that. I would really like you to teach me！

**Child**: (*Not sure if he heard the message correctly*) Do I?

**Parent**: Of course! So are you willing to teach me?

**Child**: Alright… when are you free?

Genuine praise can help break the ice and it can be the first step of engaging your teenager in a conversation.
