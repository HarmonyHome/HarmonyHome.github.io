## About
Studies of peer interaction and social competence in preschool-aged children have found that children characterized as having secure attachments with their caregivers have more ego resiliency, self-esteem, and independence.  Furthermore, they are more empathic, engaging, and demonstrate more leadership skills and problem-solving abilities in novel situations.  These developmental skills significantly help preschool-aged children succeed in classroom settings and are critical for the development of social competence and personality development.

It is widely accepted that the infant-mother/father/caretaker bond is the most important relationship in the lifespan.  It fulfilled multiple significant functions necessary for healthy development, such as feeling secure, regulating emotion, promoting exploration, and relieving distress. Therefore mothers/fathers/caretakers have the most influence during the attachment process as they are responsible for modifying their own behaviors to respond appropriately to their child
