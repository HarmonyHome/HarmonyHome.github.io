## About
This workshop will cover:

### Administration of standardized tests
To get an idea of your child’s overall cognitive functioning – this will give us some idea of your child’s readiness to cope with the academic demands in the primary school setting.

### Introduction of positive parenting principles
This will provide you with an effective tool in helping your child develop self-discipline.

### Structured tasks and free-play
This will give us the opportunity to observe how you interact with your child.  We will be in a much better position to give you feedback on how to better attune to your child’s needs and alert you on some of the parenting traps that you might have fallen into.
