## About
When children are labeled to be “inattentive”, adults who are helping them should recognize that these inattentive boys and girls often have strengths and outstanding qualities such as especially good memory on things that they likes, sharp sensitivity towards the environment.  How can parents and educators make good use of their strengths?  As they grow older, helping the children to understand themselves could help them set goals for themselves in their lives.
